            Hi, I'm Sujan Pokharel, a 6th semester BCA student at Crimson
            College of Technology, affiliated with Pokhara University. I'm
            currently a MERN stack development intern, where Iâ€™m gaining
            practical experience in building full-stack web applications using
            MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. I'm passionate about
            coding, problem-solving, and creating user-friendly digital
            solutions. I enjoy learning new technologies and working on
            real-world projects that challenge me to grow as a developer.
